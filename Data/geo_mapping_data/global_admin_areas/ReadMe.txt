Note, global admin areas can be downloaded per country from 
http://www.gadm.org/country.
For running matlab scripts I have the global database downloaded on my computer. This is a 2 gig file. 
It has therefore not been uploaded to github. 
If you want to run my scriptes to interpolate country specific data to the GCM rectangular grid you will need to download
the global admin single layer shape file from here http://www.gadm.org/version2.
