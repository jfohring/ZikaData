The National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD2011) percent tree canopy cover (TCC 2011) dataset was produced through 
a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium (www.mrlc.gov). 
TCC 2011 are NLCD tree canopy cover datasets for the a) conterminous United States, b) coastal Alaska, c) Hawaii,
and d) Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands at medium spatial resolution (30 m). Datasets were produced by the
USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC). The TCC 2011 dataset has two layers: percent tree
canopy cover and standard error. For the percent tree canopy cover layer, the pixel values range from 0 to 100 percent
and represent the percent of the ground covered by a vertical projection of tree canopies. For the standard error layer,
the pixel values range from 0 to 45 percent. The standard error represents the model uncertainty associated with the
corresponding pixel in the tree canopy cover layer. The percent tree canopy cover layer was produced using a random
forest decision tree regression algorithm and the standard error layer was calculated from the variance of the canopy 
cover estimates from the random forest regression trees. Additional information about this product is found in the
