Making a new large spreadsheet that contains station locations for temp and precip and mosi occurrences. Will add more data. 

- Need to write code to see if stations are within 5km x 5km blocks located at mosquito sighing locations.
- Need to add ground cover data next if available.
- Eventually would like disease outbreak locations as well.
